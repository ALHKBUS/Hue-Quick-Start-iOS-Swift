# Hue Quick Start iOS Swift Port

This project is a port of the Objective-C Hue Quick Start App to Swift. Available here: https://github.com/PhilipsHue/PhilipsHueSDK-iOS-OSX

I've done this as a learning exercise of Swift as well as embracing storyboards.

Pull requests and Swift pointers totally welcome :-)

This is still a work in progress...
